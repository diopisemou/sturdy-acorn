# GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è .NET 8


This repo builds a test mail API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API with .NET 8. 

We've given you b backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you‚Äôre ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we‚Äôll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

### Build Options
Run 'dotnet build' at solution level to build the backend and the library dll
Example 
```bash
$ dotnet build /Path/To/SampleApp/SampleApp.sln /property:GenerateFullPaths=true /consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary
```
